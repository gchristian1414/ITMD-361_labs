    <h1>Christian Garcia</h1>
    <h2>WHO AM I</h2>


    <p>My name is Christian Garcia, I am 21 years old and I have a passion for Soccer, Cars, and Technology.
        Since I was a kid, Computers were always my thing. I would spend hours tearing them apart and learning everything I could about them.
    </p>

    <p>
        This passion for computers is what sparked my intrest in becoming a computer science major and the ability to show creativity in my work.
    </p>

    <p>
        Combing my passion for Technology and Soccer I landed a place on the Men's Team here at IIT and it paved the walkway I stand on today. 
        I hope to continue my time here at IIT and go out and find a software engineer position once I graduate. My passion for technology 
        is what fuels my future and I wouldn't want to do anything else!

    <h2>Personal Projects</h2>
    <p>For one of my projects I created a football that is able to measure how much pressure and where the pressure was placed on the football.
        I was able to complete this by using an ESP32 with a touch sensor board extension. I wrote a script using arduino to keep track of the pressure 
        that was being read by the conductive rubber cords that were wrapped around the ball to measure the readings.
